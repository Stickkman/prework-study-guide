          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic building block of websites, handles content and structure/framework of the website.</li>
            <li>The head element contains metadata that aids in rendering the page, usually information that is not seen by user.</li>
            <li>The body element contains information that we want the user to see and interact with.  The body element is a semantic element.</li>
            <li>Common elements and what they do:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>'div' - creates a division in the page</li>
                <li>'span' - creates an inline division</li>
                <li>'h1' - used for headings/size of text, h1-h6 with size decending, only use one h1 heading per page.</li>
                <li>'p' - for paragraphs or blocks of text, used extensively to wrap most text on webpages</li>
                <li>'ul' - unordered lists</li>
                <li>'ol' - ordered lists</li>
                <li>'li' - list items</li>
                <li>'br' - line break, creates a line of empty space</li>
                <li>'header' - appears at top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu or intro content</li>
                <li>'footer' - appears at the bottom of the page, usually ocntains author, copyright, contact info, site map, etc</li>
                <li>'section' - semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>  
                </ul>
                                  
          </ul>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Stands for Cascading Style Sheets, used to give content style.</li>
            <li> 'margin' - indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element</li>
            <li> 'padding' - indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element</li>
            <li> Can use '*' to mark all elements instead of a specific one. </li>
            <li> Can use the 'class' attribute to share a rule with any element in that class.</li> 
             <li>3 ways to style a page using CSS:</li>
             <ul> 
                <li>Inline CSS - Elements are styled directly in the HTML files, applies to a particular page element only.  Useful for 
                  quick and permanent changes, but less flexible than external and internal style sheets.</li>
                <li>Internal CSS style sheet - Embeds an entire style sheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head, 
                  rules only apply to that page. </li>
                <li>External CSS style sheet - Most common way to style a webpage.  Must link the file using the 'link' element.</li>
                 
              </ul>

          <h2>GIT</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A free open source version control system that enables web developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work.</li>
            <li>Allows developers to revert to previous version of code</li>
            <li>Used with Gitbash, which allows users to use standard unix commands that they would not be able to use otherwise</li>
            <li>Common commands:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>'git status' - checks what branch we are currently on</li>
              <li>'git checkout' - changes to specified branch</li>
              <li>'git checkout -b' - creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
              <li>'pwd' - print working directory, shows current working directory</li>
              <li>'ls' - list, shows all files and folder in current directory</li>
              <li>'cd' - change directory, (cd ..) goes back a level</li>
              <li>'mkdir' - make directory</li>
              <li>'touch' - creates a file</li>
              <li>'start' - opens a file with default app</li>
              <li>'git pull origin main' - *in case local directory is not up to date with github*</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Always remember to create a new branch off of the main branch before adding or editing code.</li>
            <li> Basic Workflow process:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Create a branch from most recent version of the main branch.</li>
              <li>Add commits including brief text describing what was done.</li>
              <li>Open PR, short for Pull Request, content changes are reviewed by team.</li>
              <li>Merge and Deploy, content changes are approved and publish.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Dynamic high level programming language that allows users to interact with websites.  Uses include adding effects, interactivity, highlighting clickable items, etc.</li>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, any variable can be assigned and re-assigned values.  Example:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>foo = 42 // foo is now a number.</li>
              <li>foo = "hello" // foo is now a string.</li>
              <li>foo = true; // foo is now a boolean.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, typically related.  Can store different types of data at once.</li>
            <li>To work with individual items inside an array, we need to have the location within the array, referred to as an index.</li>
            <li>The first item in any array has an index of '0' rather than '1'.</li>
            <li>We can find the length of an array by using it's built-in ''.length' property added to the end of the array's name.  Useful for 'for' loops.</li>
            <li> A 'for' loop contains 3 important statements:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The first determines the starting point for our loop.</li>
              <li>The second is the condition that keeps the loop running.</li>
              <li>The third allows the array to iterate over each item.  Using 'x++' is an example of this to add 1 to a variable of x to keep count. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>The .js file must be linked in the html file near the bottom of the page, because you want the elements it will be manipulating to load first.</li>
            <li>We can comment out multiple lines of code opening with '/*' and ending with '*/'.  // can be used for a single line.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>Code flows from top to bottom in JavaScript.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is CASE SENSITIVE, ex. 'myVariable' does not equal 'myvariable'</li>
            <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.  Useful for code we want to reuse.</li>
            <li>Functions do not execute automatically, they must be called by their unique name.</li>
            <li>Chrome DevTools is useful when debugging, can be accessed by right clicking > inspect > console.  Also with CTRL+SHIFT+I. </li>
